# REGISTER NUMBER : 25012884

# Aim: 
To write the prompts for these following prompt types and evaluate that using any one method :

1. Straightforward Prompts

2. Tabular Format Prompting

3. Preceding Question Prompting

4. Missing Word Prompting

# Explanation 
Any one use case from Unit 5 and generate the report for that with the unit 2 Prompt type

# Prompts and their Explanations :

## 1.Straightforward Prompts:
Prompt:"Define photosynthesis in one sentence."<br>
Output:<br>
Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants use sunlight, carbon dioxide, and water to produce food (glucose) and release oxygen.

Prompt:"List three advantages of electric vehicles."<br>
Output:<br>
1. They reduce air pollution by producing no tailpipe emissions.<br>
2. They have lower operating and maintenance costs compared to petrol or diesel vehicles.<br>
3. They improve energy efficiency and reduce dependence on fossil fuels.<br>

## 2.Tabular Format Prompting:

Prompt: "Compare and contrast AC and DC current in a table."<br>
Output:<br>

| Feature           | AC (Alternating Current)                 | DC (Direct Current)                    |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| Direction of flow | Changes direction periodically           | Flows in one direction only            |
| Magnitude         | Varies with time                         | Constant magnitude                     |
| Source            | Power stations, generators               | Batteries, solar cells                 |
| Frequency         | Has frequency (e.g., 50 Hz or 60 Hz)     | Zero frequency                         |
| Transmission      | Efficient for long-distance transmission | Less efficient for long distances      |
| Usage             | Homes, offices, industries               | Electronic devices, charging systems   |
| Conversion        | Easily converted to DC using rectifiers  | Can be converted to AC using inverters |<br>

## 3. Preceding Question Prompting:

Prompt:	"Why is climate change a global concern? Explain how greenhouse gases contribute to global warming."<br>
Output:<br>
Climate change is a global concern because it affects all countries through rising temperatures, extreme weather events, sea-level rise, food insecurity, and threats to human health and ecosystems, making international cooperation essential to address its impacts.<br>
Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide contribute to global warming by trapping heat in the Earth’s atmosphere. These gases allow sunlight to enter but prevent some of the outgoing heat from escaping into space, creating a greenhouse effect that increases the Earth’s average temperature over time.<br>

Prompt:"How do vaccines work? Describe the process of immunization in simple terms."<br>
Output:<br>
Vaccines work by training the body’s immune system to recognize and fight a specific disease without causing the illness.<br>
In simple terms, a vaccine contains a weakened, killed, or harmless part of a germ. When it enters the body, the immune system learns to identify it and produces antibodies. If the real germ later infects the body, the immune system remembers it and can quickly destroy it, preventing the person from getting sick or making the illness much milder.<br>
